In this project, the data I'm working with includes a loan dataset sourced from a US affiliate bank. The goal of this dataset is to estimate the probability of default for personal accounts.

Key Issues Addressed:

- Credit Risk Assessment: The main challenge is identifying which personal accounts are likely to default on loans. This is important for the bank to manage risks and make informed lending decisions.

- Data Cleaning and Preparation, this includes:

	- Removing Redundancies: I need to ensure there are no duplicate entries that could affect the analysis.
	- Handling Missing Values: Missing data needs to be addressed, as it could point to issues in the loan applications. Dealing with this data properly is essential for accurate modeling.
	- Feature Engineering: This involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for model building, like converting currency values (e.g., dollars to Euros) and creating dummy variables for categorical data.
	- Documentation of Changes: It's important to keep track of any modifications made to the dataset so that the data scientists who conduct the analysis have a clear understanding of the changes.
	- By focusing on these areas, the project aims to build a strong dataset that can enhance the performance of the credit risk model.
